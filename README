This is Student Case Study about node.js + mongoDB by international company Atomia.
Here you can find simple restful/JSON web interface with following features:
- data representation in tree form with expansion/collapse option
- list all data in one collection
- find data by objectId
- add new JSON object with arbitrary number of attributes
- remove data by objectId

All request from client to server are performed using jQuery.ajax.
On server side, we need NODE executable file, MongoDB instalation and node.js driver for MongoDB.

Further, you can see a brief description about
- what you need to download
- how to install required programs on local mashine 
to start up this interface and be capable to move on.

First of all, it is assumed that you have github account and gitbash installed on pc.
